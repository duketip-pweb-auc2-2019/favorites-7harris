        <h2><p>You've been dropped into a world full of green grasses and bushes, and blue skies because your princess was kidnapped by the enemy, "Bowser". Collect coins and other useful items on your journey. Usually they are found in boxes with question marks, or just brick boxes. The sunflower is beneficial to whichever character you chose because mow you can shoot fireballs at the enemies/obstacles you find almost everywhere on your journey. There are also other items you can find to benefit your character such as the blue turtle shells that can cover you and run over enemies.    As you try to find your way to the princess, you encounter boss levels. There are eight worlds, and each world has two bosses, and the eighth world has three boss battles. So that means that there are a total of seventeen boss fights. Defeat the bosses for a clue for what is yet to come.    You can jump on enemies to defeat them. Getting coins can help you go to shops. Shops usually cost five coins. Each level you can collect up to three coins. Shops give you items that you can use later in your adventure if you want.After killing an enemy, acquiring an item, or grabbing coins, you get points. If you get a streak of One-thousand points, you get an extra life. Have fun playing SUPER MARIO BROS!</p></h2>
